    <p id = 'message' class='element-to-fade'>We are a group of students enrolled in the Math, Science, and Technology Center at Paul Laurence Dunbar High School. We all take academics seriously and aim to use our knowledge to help students excel in school. We believe that every student deserves the opportunity to receive high-quality co-curricular education and because of this we offer our tutoring services at the competitive price of $13 per hour.  Students will receive one-on-one tutoring with personalized lessons catered to their needs. All funds are used to maintain and improve our business, and any excess money is donated to the Dance Blue charity, supporting cancer research. Ultimately, we aim to battle cancer by helping students learn the skills they need to succeed in school.
